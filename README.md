## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- Regardless of whatever customer requirements you may receive an unwritten requirement will always be that the software provided actually runs. My preferred method of this is to work through coding software in small chunks. For example, when writing a calculator application, it would make sense to code an addition function, test and then code a minus function. After each function is validated, it would make sense to write unit tests so that with the addition of new software you can quickly test added functionality and validate that new code doesn't break the program. 

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- Each user of a an application is unique, given that each application intends to serve a purpose or solve a problem, user needs can be derived based solving that problem easier. The majority of users on your system can have a similar issue, and it is up to you as the developer to find those needs. Interviewing users, application surveys, and performaing a system analysis are all ways one can find needs a user might have that are not being met. From here you should diagram how they can be incorporated into the existing architecture, and then prototyped, tested, and implemented when ready. 

## How do I approach designing software?
- When it comes to designing software, I would start by understanding the problem and requirements, then break those down into smaller, manageable components. Then I can design the system iteratively, prioritizing modularity, scalability, and maintainability while regularly testing and refining the software.
